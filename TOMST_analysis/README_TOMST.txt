## Data collection notes summer 2022 - Who, when, where, why and how the data were collected
TOMST data from 24 weather stations in Garibaldi Park placed in and out of the warming chambers.
Three subsites (Salix dominated (mesic), heather dominated (dry) and sedge dominated (wet)).
Place in the field July 21 2022 (Cassandra and Anya placed in plots) and removed Oct1 2022 (Cassandra downloaded data). 
Measures three temperatures (soil (12cm depth), ground and 12cm up) and soil mositure (raw voltage).
Ground level sensors did not have shields on for summer 2022 so recorded temps without shading from sun.
