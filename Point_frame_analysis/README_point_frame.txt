## Data collection notes summer 2022 - Who, when, where, why and how the data were collected
Point frame data from 24 1mx1m plots in Garibaldi Park placed in and out of open top warming chambers.
Three subsites (Salix dominated (mesic), heather dominated (dry) and sedge dominated (wet)).
Warming chambers installed in the field July 21 2022  and removed Oct1 2022. 
2022 Composition data was collected August 4-6 at the Sedge site, August 7-9 at the Cassiope site and Sept 24-25 at the Salix site.
Started out at the Sedge site measuring the full 100 points but then began doing only 70 points for time. Appeared to capture most of the diversity in 70 points.
Point frame corners were marked with orange flags for future years. In some plots the 1mx1m plot was marked and in others the exact placement of the point frame legs.
Data collected by: Cassandra ELphinstone, Courtney Collins, Joanna Gower, Noemie Boulanger-Lapointe, Vincent Hanlon, Anya Boardman, and Spencer Nicholas
